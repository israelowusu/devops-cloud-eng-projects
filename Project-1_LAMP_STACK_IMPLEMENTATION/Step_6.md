## Step 6: Enable PHP on the Website

In this step, you will configure Apache to prioritize `index.php` over `index.html` and test PHP functionality by creating a PHP script. This ensures that Apache can correctly process PHP files for your website.

### Overview

By default, Apache’s `DirectoryIndex` settings prioritize `index.html` files over `index.php` files. This can be useful for maintenance pages but may need adjustment if you want PHP files to take precedence. You will also create a PHP test script to confirm that PHP is correctly installed and configured.

### Instructions

#### 1. Update Apache DirectoryIndex Settings

1. **Edit DirectoryIndex Configuration**:
   - Open the `dir.conf` file in Apache’s configuration directory:

     ```bash
     sudo vim /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/dir.conf
     ```

2. **Modify DirectoryIndex Directive**:
   - Locate the `DirectoryIndex` line and change the order to prioritize `index.php` over `index.html`. Update the line to look like this:

     ```apache
     <IfModule mod_dir.c>
         DirectoryIndex index.php index.html index.cgi index.pl index.xhtml index.htm
     </IfModule>
     ```

   - This change ensures that `index.php` is served before `index.html` if both files exist in the directory.

3. **Save and Close the File**:
   - Press `ESC` to exit insert mode.
   - Type `:wq` and press `ENTER` to save and close the file.

4. **Reload Apache**:
   - Apply the configuration changes by reloading Apache:

     ```bash
     sudo systemctl reload apache2
     ```

#### 2. Create a PHP Test Script

1. **Create the PHP File**:
   - Open a new file named `index.php` in your website’s root directory:

     ```bash
     vim /var/www/projectlamp/index.php
     ```

2. **Add PHP Code**:
   - Insert the following PHP code into the file:

     ```php
     <?php
     phpinfo();
     ?>
     ```

   - This code generates a page displaying PHP configuration and environment details.

3. **Save and Close the File**:
   - Press `ESC` to exit insert mode.
   - Type `:wq` and press `ENTER` to save and close the file.

4. **Test PHP Functionality**:
   - Open your web browser and navigate to your website:

     ```text
     http://<Public-IP-Address>:80
     ```

   - Replace `<Public-IP-Address>` with your EC2 instance’s public IP address.

   - You should see a page generated by PHP showing detailed information about your PHP configuration.

5. **Remove the PHP Test File**:
   - For security reasons, it’s best to remove the `index.php` file after confirming that PHP is working:

     ```bash
     sudo rm /var/www/projectlamp/index.php
     ```

### Conclusion

You have successfully configured Apache to prioritize `index.php` files and tested PHP functionality on your server. The PHP test page provided valuable information about your PHP setup and confirmed that PHP is processing correctly.

With PHP now enabled and working, you can proceed to develop and deploy dynamic web applications on your LAMP stack server. If you have any issues or need further assistance, consult Apache and PHP documentation or seek support from relevant communities.
